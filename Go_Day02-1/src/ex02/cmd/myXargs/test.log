Exercise 02: Running Things
Do you know what xargs is? You can read about it here, for example. Let's implement a similar tool - in this exercise you'll need to write a utility that will:

treat all parameters as a command, like 'wc -l' or 'ls -la'
build a command by appending all lines that are fed to program's stdin as this command's arguments, then execute it. So if we run


~$ echo -e "/a\n/b\n/c" | ./myXargs ls -la


it should be an equivalent to running

~$ ls -la /a /b /c


You can test this tool together with those from previous Exercises, so

~$ ./myFind -f -ext 'log' /path/to/some/logs | ./myXargs ./myWc -l


will calculate line counts for all ".log" files in /path/to/some/logs directory recursively.
